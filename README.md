# ChromaDB.Client

ChromaDB.Client is a C# cross-platform library for communication with ChromaDB Vector database. ChromaDB is a fast and scalable database that uses vector similarity search to enable complex queries on high-dimensional data.

With ChromaDB.Client, you can easily connect to a ChromaDB instance, create and manage collections, perform CRUD operations on the data in the collections, and execute other available operations such as nearest neighbor search, aggregation, and filtering.

This library is still in early development and not ready for production use by any means.
